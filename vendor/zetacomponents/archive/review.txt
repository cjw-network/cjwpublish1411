ezcArchive

- ezcArchive::appendToCurrent() should return an instance / an array of
  entries of the newly created ezcArchiveEntry(s) for convenience.
- ezcArchive::<constants> how is it possible to combine 2 archive formats,
  e.g. tar.gz?
- Documentation does not explain well, which drivers are capable of
  read/write/read-write. In general the documentation is very unclear.
- A convenience method to recursively create an archive from a directory with
  1 call should be provided.
- Newly created archives are not removed, if an error occurs during their
  creation (e.g. error message below).
- Error message "The archive </tmp/ezcArchiverTempeC6Qnu> has an invalid block
  size. At least one block expected in tar archive" not very helpful. IMHO
  ezcArchive should just use the file, if it's completly empty, and create the
  specified archive type in it.
- There is no possibility to wrap a created TAR into gz/bzip2 compression.
  There should be at least a method to do so on a TAR archive, so that the
  native PHP functions must not be used.
- Determination of archive types from their filename extension while creating
  archives would be very neat.
- A lot of classes will never be used by end users, like ezcArchiveGnuHeader,
  ezcArchiveFileStructure, etc. These classes should be marked as @access
  private, to not blow up documentation with it.
