Review Frederik 7. dec 2005
===========================
[done] ezcConfiguration::__construct - it's not really obvious what the format of $settings and $comments is.
[done] ezcConfiguration::groupSettingCheck - rename to assertGroupSetting?
[done] ezcConfiguration::groupNames - has no implementation

[done] ezcConfigurationWriter::setOptions - what options are available?

[bogus] ezcConfigurationFileWriter - shouldn't getSuffix be declared as an abstract method here?
[bogus] ezcConfigurationManager - fetchConfig, fetchSetting and the other setting methods. Something doesn't feel right about the names here.

[done] ezcConfigurationIniWriter - The doc for writeSettings is a bit confusing. It says $settings but talks about groups. Could you clarify this?
