/**
 * Provides the result of an ezcConfigurationFileReader::validate() operation.
 *
 * It contains the result of the validation process. The reader will create the
 * result with location information and the validation items which is returned to
 * the caller.
 *
 * Instantiate an object of this class and append items using
 * appendItem(). The caller can then access the result using getResultList().
 *
 * The reader will typically create the result with:
 * <code>
 * $validationError = new ezcConfigurationValidationItem(
 *     ezcConfigurationValidationItem::ERROR,
 *     'test-file.php', 2, 4, 'typo', 'One ] too many'
 * );
 *
 * $result = new ezcConfigurationValidationResult(
 *     "settings", "site", "settings/site.ini"
 * );
 *
 * $result->appendItem( $validationError );
 * </code>
 *
 * After the reader is done parsing, the validation results can be examined with:
 * <code>
 * echo "Warnings: ", $result->getWarningCount(), "\n";
 * echo "Errors:   ", $result->getErrorCount(), "\n";
 * foreach ( $result->getResultList() as $item )
 * {
 *     printf( "In '%s' on line '%d', position: '%d': %s\n",
 *         $item->file, $item->line, $item->column, $item->details
 *     );
 * }
 * </code>
