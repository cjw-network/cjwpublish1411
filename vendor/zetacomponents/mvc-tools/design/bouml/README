Bouml IDS
=========

Instructions
------------

Each user working with the same bouml diagrams needs a different id for bouml.
This id is an int from 1 to 99, and is set in the environment variable BOUML_ID.

Example setup::

  $ echo export BOUML_ID="32" >> ~/.bashrc

Subversion should ignore the temporary session files of bouml,
which are in the project directory.

Example, if your id is 25::

  $ svn propset svn:ignore true 25.*
