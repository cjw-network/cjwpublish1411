=================
Supported clients
=================

The Webdav component is constantly tested against different WebDAV clients.
The following clients are included in the tests:

- Nautilus (GNOME)
- Konqueror (KDE)
- Cadaver (Unix/Linux shell)
- MS InternetExplorer 6 (Windows)
- MS InternetExplorer 7 (Windows)
- Litmus (Unix test suite for WebDAV servers)

=============
Client issues
=============

Some clients do not behave compliant to RFC 2518. While the WebDAV component
is designed to work around such issues, some client problems cannot be fixed.
This sections lists known bugs in WebDAV clients, which prevent some actions
to work correctly with the Webdav component.

--------
Nautilus
--------

Downloading of folders
======================

Nautilus does not support downloading of folders recursively. While it handles
recursive upload fine, it attempts to download a collection using a simple GET
request and fails, since it retrieves an empty file. This issue occurs in every
version at least until Nautilus 2.28.1 (gvfs/1.4.1).

Copying of folders
==================

It is not possible to copy folders on a WebDAV server using Nautilus due to the
previously named issue. Instead of using the WebDAV COPY statement, Nautilus
tries to download the collection using GET and PUT it up again.

A `bug for this issue`__ exists in the Gnome bug tracker.

---------
Konqueror
---------

Version 3.5.9 (possibly earlier) did not perform uploads of new file. The
client first checks if the file to upload already exists on the server, which
results in a (usually expected) 404 error. Konquerors error handling steps in
here and avoids the upload.

Version 3.5.10 (possibly earlier and later) works fine with the Webdav
component, due to a workaround added in version 1.1.
