Testing the Library
===================

This chapter describes how to run the tests that are included with this library.

First clone the repository, install the vendors, then run the tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSHttpCache.git
    $ cd FOSHttpCache
    $ composer install --dev
    $ phpunit

Unit Tests
----------

To run the unit tests separately:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ phpunit tests/Unit

Functional Tests
----------------

The library also includes functional tests against a Varnish instance. The
functional test suite by default uses PHPâ€™s built-in web server. If you have
PHP 5.4 or newer, simply run with the default configuration.

If you want to run the tests on PHP 5.3, you need to configure a web server
listening on localhost:8080 that points to the folder
``tests/Functional/Fixtures/web``.

If you want to run the tests on HHVM_, you need to configure a web server and
start a `HHVM FastCGI server`_.

To run the functional tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ phpunit tests/Functional

For more information about testing, see :doc:`/testing-your-application`.
