Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

The FOSHttpCache library is available on Packagist_. You can install it using
Composer_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require friendsofsymfony/http-cache:~1.0

.. note::

    This library follows `Semantic Versioning`_. Because constraint ``~1.0``
    will only increment the minor and patch numbers, it will not introduce BC
    breaks.

Configuration
-------------

There are three things you need to do to get started:

1. :doc:`configure your caching proxy <proxy-configuration>`
2. :doc:`set up a client for your caching proxy <proxy-clients>`
3. :doc:`set up the cache invalidator <cache-invalidator>`

Overview
--------

This library mainly consists of:

* low-level clients for communicating with caching proxies (Varnish and Nginx)
* a cache invalidator that acts as an abstraction layer for the caching proxy
  clients
* test classes that you can use for integration testing your application
  against a caching proxy.

Measures have been taken to minimise the performance impact of sending
invalidation requests:

* Requests are not sent immediately, but aggregated to be sent in parallel.
* You can determine when the requests should be sent. For optimal performance,
  do so after the response has been sent to the client.
