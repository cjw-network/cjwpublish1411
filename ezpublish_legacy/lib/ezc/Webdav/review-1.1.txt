Review Alexandru 05-11-2008
---------------------------

[x] ezcWebdavMemoryBackend, ezcWebdavSimpleBackend and maybe other classes have
the extends and implements on many lines - I thought it was already discussed
on IRC to have everything on one line. (from previous review.txt)

# TS: Did not notice that. Please clearify and add it to the guidelines so we
# can make it consistent.

AS: it is not in the guidelines yet. But one side-effect of putting the parent
classes on multiple lines is that they are not displayed in the Class Tree
(http://ezcomponents.org/docs/api/trunk/classtrees_Webdav.html).


[x] ChangeLog: [RELEASEDATE] not converted to real date on 1.1alpha1 release.

[x] In some files the @copyright and @license tags appear 2 times.

[x] In /src/backends/file.php the $depth constants are not used in
    copyRecursive() (-1 and 0 appear)

[x] Some files have different class name in header ("File containing the XXX class).

[x] "return null;" is commented-out in some files.

- Some typos in the code and comments:

[x] /src/server.php
    Nounce -> Nonce
