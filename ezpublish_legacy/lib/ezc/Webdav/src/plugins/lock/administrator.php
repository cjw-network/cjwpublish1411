 * constructor. You should have the {@link ezcWebdavServer} already configured
 * when you use an instance of this class, since it uses settings from {@link
 * ezcWebdavLockPluginOptions}. In case the lock plugin is not configured in
 * the server, a new (default) instance of it will be added before any
 * administrative action and will be removed again afterwards. In addition, any
 * authentication/authorization mechanism configured in the server will be
 * de-activated before any administrative operation and is brought back into
 * place afterward.
