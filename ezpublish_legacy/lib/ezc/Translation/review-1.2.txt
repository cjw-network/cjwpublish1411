- Why does ezcTranslation->parameter_callback_compile() use _ instead of
  CamelCase?

	- No idea... probably because it was made like parameter_callback which is
	  old. I changed them now as they are private methods anyway.

- Method name ezcTranslationTsBackend->deinitWriter() sounds strange.
  closeWriter() or similar would be better.

	- It's analogous to ->initWriter() - I do agree it sounds strange, but we
	  can not change it as it has been here for quite some releases now.
