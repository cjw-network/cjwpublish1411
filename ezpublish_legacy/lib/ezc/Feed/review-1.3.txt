- All operations (addAttribute, createElement, getAttribute) that work on
  namespaced elements (such as atom:link) should use the namespace-aware
  variants of this method (addAttributeNs, createElementNS). In
  generateAtomSelfLink that would also prevent you from having to add the
  "xmlns:atom" attribute yourself.
