Review Alexandru 2009-07-31
===========================

[x] new tests storage_object_test.php depend on classes/exportable.php which
    is not in SVN. Hence the Cache test suite fails.

[x] the file storage_object_test.php contains references to ezcStorageFileArray

[x] cache_autoload.php references ezcCacheFileObjectSerializer which doesn't exist

[x] tests/suite.php references ezcCacheStorageFileObjectTest which doesn't exist

	It does, just the file naming is not consistent. Fixed that. --ts
