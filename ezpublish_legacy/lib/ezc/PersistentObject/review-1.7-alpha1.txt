Review 05.08.09 - PO 1.7-alpha1
===============================

Changes review
--------------

[X] The exception catchall in handlers/load_handler.php +66 seems strange, and
    the TODO indicates that the exception catching shouldn't be that generic -
    why has it been implemented this way?

General review
--------------

Seems fine.
