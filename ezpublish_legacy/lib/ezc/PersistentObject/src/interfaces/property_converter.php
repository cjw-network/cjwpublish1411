/**
 * Interface that must be implemented by property converter classes.
 *
 * This is the base interface that needs to be implemented by property
 * converter classes. A property converter object can be assigned to a {@link
 * ezcPersistentObjectProperty} instance, to enable automatic manipulation of
 * database values.
 *
 * After a value has been loaded from the database, the {@link fromDatabase()}
 * method will be called, receiving this value, and it's return value will be
 * used in the persistent objects property instead of the raw database value.
 * Right before storing a persistent object back to the database, the {@link
 * toDatabase()} method will be called, receiving the current property value,
 * and the return value of this method will be stored into the database.
 *
 * The same property converter object might be assigend to several {@link
 * ezcPersistentObjectProperty} instances to reduce the number of needed
 * objects.
 * 
 * @package PersistentObject
