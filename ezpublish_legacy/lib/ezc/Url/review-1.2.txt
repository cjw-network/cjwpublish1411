Review by Derick
================

[-] I am not sure if the name for the new option constant for
	addUnorderedParameter() are good - the
	ezcUrlConfiguration::AGGREGATE_ARGUMENTS one. Perhaps
	MULTIPLE_ARRAY_ARGUMENTS would work? Or perhaps MULTIPLE_ARGUMENTS |
	ARRAY_ARGUMENTS would be a viable alternative? I think the latter makes
	most sense, but is slightly more to type.

	I think the AGGREGATE_ARGUMENTS is better.

[ ] parseQueryString() will most likely have locale issues - needs
    investigating.

[X] In ReST, the following things are equivalent:
    For example, if the $_SERVER array has these fields: ::
    and:
    For example, if the $_SERVER array has these fields::

	- Done

=======================

[X] It would be nice to have some more class level documentation for
	ezcUrlTools, or at least mention it only provides static methods.

	- Done.
