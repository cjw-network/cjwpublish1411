Changes to BC and behavior in version 5.2
=========================================

INI setting changes
-------------------


Change of behavior
------------------

- Fixed EZP-18195: $result.object is not correctly created

  eZContentObject->assignedNodes( false ):
  * Does not return columns "id" and "contentobject_id" anymore.
  * Returns "ezcontentobject.remote_id" under the "object_remote_id" key,
  "remote_id" key still contains "ezcontentobject_tree.remote_id".

  eZContentObjectTreeNode::subTreeByNodeID() and
  eZContentObjectTreeNode::subTreeMultiPaths() does not internally use columns
  "ezcontentobject_tree.contentobject_id" and "ezcontentobject.name" anymore.
  If you relied on those with extended attribute filtering using an "HAVING"
  clause, replaces "ezcontentobject_tree.contentobject_id" by
  "ezcontentobject.id" and add "ezcontentobject.name" to the additional
  columns to be retrieved if you used it.

  eZContentObjectTreeNode::findMainNodeArray( [...], false ),
  eZContentObjectTreeNode::fetch( [...], [...], false ) and:
  eZContentObjectTreeNode::fetchNodesByPathString( [...], [...], false ):
  eZContentObjectTreeNode::fetchByRemoteID( [...], false );
  eZContentObjectTreeNode::fetchByPath( [...], false );
  eZContentObjectTreeNode::fetchByURLPath( [...], false );
  * Does not return key "contentobject_id" in addition to "id" anymore, use
  the "id" key instead.
  * Returns "ezcontentobject.remote_id" under the "object_remote_id" key,
  "remote_id" key still contains "ezcontentobject_tree.remote_id".

- Fixed EZP-20766: Wrong default value for CLUSTER_HEADER_X_POWERED_BY in index_cluster.php

  The previous default value (true) led to X-Powered-By being set to 1 (true cast to integer).
  From 5.2, the default value will be set to "eZ Publish".

- menu.ini\[Leftmenu_<menu>]

  Links in left menu are now by default disabled in browse mode.
  This can now be changed per item using the new Enabled_<link>[<ui_context>] setting.

- Fix EZP-21358: ezjscAjaxContent: Image's exif fields MakerNote and UserComment must be base64 encoded

  ezjscAjaxContent now returns image's exif fields MakerNote and UserComment base64 encoded.

- The eZDFSFileHandlerMySQLiBackend::TABLE_METADATA constant has been removed

  See http://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-18865

- Cluster: MySQLi handler for DFS now uses a separate table to store cache.

  A maintenance operation is recommended in order to remove cache from the main table. If you'd rather not do this
  operation, you can revert to the old behaviour by setting the cache table to the old one. This can be done by
  setting the CLUSTER_METADATA_TABLE_CACHE to ezdfsfile in config.cluster.php.

  More information can be found on the online documentation.

- Globals in scripts is no longer supported (not working via ezpublish:legacy:script)

  PHP Scripts executed via command line no longer supports assuming global variables in them.
  This was broken earlier in 5.x when we introduced Symfony command ezpublish:legacy:script
  to be able to execute legacy scripts while still making sure the integration works. This
  approach can not technically work with globals, so make sure to refactor your extensions
  in similar way(s) to how we are doing it in the legacy kernel:

Removed features
----------------


Removed constants
-----------------

- eZContentLanguage::MAX_COUNT

  The number of languages supported cannot be hold in a constant anymore, the
  method eZContentLanguage::maxCount() should be used instead.


Removed globals

Deprecated
