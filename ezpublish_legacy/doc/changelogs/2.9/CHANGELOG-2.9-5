- Changed browse page. Now the path is shown like on other eZ Publish pages

- Changed the ezprice interface with VAT type choosing and VAT include/exclude choosing.

*Library :

eZ utils:
- Added function for automatically remove escaped ' and " characters done by magic quote

eZ locale:
- Added function for returning the timestamp of a date

eZ text codec:
- A new function /conversionRequired/ can be used to detect if it's necessary to call
  the conversion functions in text codec. This improves speed for code which handles
  lots of strings.

eZ session:
- Made sure db is not included or initialized before actually needed, before there were some problems
  with ini files and siteaccess.

eZ debug:
- Made sure debug messages are ignored when debug is off.
- New feature: Accumulators, they can be used for profiling how much time
  a part the program takes.
- Added support for total script time.
- No string conversion is run if it is not required, this means sql queries are much faster.
- Missing directories will be created.
- If log file could not be opened for writing it will disable file logging and issue an error.
- Made sure serverVariable access does not issue an error.
- Added @s to some file functions, to avoid that they create error messages.

eZ db:
- New function /setIsSQLOutputEnabled/ which can enable or disable sql output at runtime,
  sql output is always disabled at the end of the script to avoid crashes with session.

eZ mysqldb:
- If a connect fails the error will be present in the error output.

eZ template:
- Moved template parser code into separate classes, that way it should be fairly easy to change the
  parser engine.
- Made some changes to bring back the element tree caching.
- Added simple element tree caching, it will store the cache in /var/cache/template/tree/

eZPHPCreator
- New class for generating PHP cache files.

eZ setup:
- setup tool for eZ publish. Set the setting CheckValidity in site.ini to true and install eZ
  publish.
- tests if eZ publish can work: PHP version, DB modules, PHP modules, ImageMagick, File
  permissions
- helps with suggestions what to do if any steps fail
- installs the database: DB type, DB server, DB name, DB charset, creates new DB user if wanted
- installs demo data: unpacks it (if zlib module is available) and install database content
- sets some initial configuration settings (title, domain, charset)
- sends (if wanted) register email to eZ szstems. Can use SMTP server (w/ login) to send email.

eZ sys:
- The functions serverVariable and environmentVariable now takes an optional second parameter called
  quiet, if true no debug error is shown, default is false.

eZ execution:
- New class which helps in detecting fatal errors and does proper end of execution cleanups.
