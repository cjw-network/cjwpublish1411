Changes from 3.5.0rc2 to 3.5.0

*Kernel:
- Enabled debug summary report for redirects and added the count for each error
  type.
- Fixed a problem in redirection when the redirect url did not start with a
  slash.
- Fixed wrong creation of tree node in content/versionview which could lead to
  undefined member variables.
- Added a third parameter to eZPreferences::setValue which can be used to
  define which user should get the preference value. If set to false it will
  use the current user which is the default behaviour.

Setup:
- The setup wizard will now create a preference entry for the admin user which
  sets the 'preview' block in the admin interface to open by default.
