*Title: Section edit

*Incentive:
For sites using many different sections or lots of sub-tree section changes this should save a lot of time.

*Documentation:
Allows you to edit an objects section in the admin object edit view.

This possibility provides an additional module to the object edit view of the admin interface. 
A dropdown is placed in the object edit view to allow quick section changes 
without having to go through the setup tab.
