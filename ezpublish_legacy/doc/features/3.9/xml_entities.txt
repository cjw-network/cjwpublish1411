*Title: XML numeric entities handling.

*Documentation:

Its possible to store foreign characters in XML documents now.
The following setting should be set to true:

ezxml [InputSettings].AllowNumericEntities

Now you can use numeric entities in your documents, like: &#1234;
This is useful to enter single special characters like greek letters even if
they are not supported by the current charset.
