301 Moved Permantently status
=============================

The system will now set the 301 status when doing redirects due to
moved objects. This will allow external search engines and other bots
to update their existing URLs with the new location.

In addition the modules can set the HTTP status for redirects by
calling *setRedirectStatus()* in eZModule, e.g::

  $Module->setRedirectStatus( "301 Moved Permanently" );
