*Title: Improved LDAP user management

*Original author: Bard Farstad

*Documentation:
It's possible now keep the user group assignment of users which are synced with
LDAP. The default behaviour in eZ Publish is to move them back to the group
they are configured to be placed in. Now you can move LDAP users to a different
group and they will not be automatically moved back when the user logs in again

A new ini setting is provided:
[ldap.ini].LDAPSettings.KeepGroupAssignment=enabled/disabled
