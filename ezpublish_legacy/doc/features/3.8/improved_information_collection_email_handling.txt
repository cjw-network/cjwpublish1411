*Title: Cc/Bcc feature for collection forms

*Original author: Ronnie Garcia

*Documentation:
Two template variables were added: email_cc_receivers and email_bcc_receivers.
You can use them like you're used 'to'.
For example:
{set-block scope=root variable=email_cc_receivers}
    {$object.data_map.cc_recipient.content}
{/set-block}
{set-block scope=root variable=email_bcc_receivers}
    {$object.data_map.bcc_recipient.content}
{/set-block}
