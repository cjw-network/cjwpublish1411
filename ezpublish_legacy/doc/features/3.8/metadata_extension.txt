*Title: Metadata Extension

*Documentation:
A list of extensions which have metadata extractor handlers
It's common to create a settings/binaryfile.ini.append.php file
in your extension and add the extension name to automatically
get handlers from the extension when it's turned on.
Handlers need to be placed in the extension subdir "plugins".

*Examples
A working example can be found under
