*Title: LDAP login: Allow non-anonymous bind

*Documentation:
In order to login using LDAP, we first have to do a bind to the LDAP server. 
Some server are not set up to allow anonymous bind. In those cases we need to 
supply a username and password for the bind. (Note: This is not the same 
username/password that is used when logging in the user into eZ Publish!) The 
patch simply adds the needed parameters to ldap.ini, and uses them with 
ldap_bind() in the two files where it is needed.
