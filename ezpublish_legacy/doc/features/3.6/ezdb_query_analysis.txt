Title: eZDB query analysis

Documentation:
The eZDB interface is now given the possiblity to run an analysis of each query
and display the result with the SQL output.

The analyis depends on the database type and is only supported with MySQL for now.

To enable it the site.ini setting QueryAnalysisOutput (DatabaseSetings group) must
be set to enabled.

Example:
[DebugSettings]
QueryAnalysisOutput=enabled
