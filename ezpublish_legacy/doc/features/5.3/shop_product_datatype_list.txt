Shop Module
============

It is now possible to define a list of datatypes containing prices. This will
allow you to add custom datatypes and work with them in the shop.

Before this setting, you were restricted to use "ezprice" and/or "ezmultiprice" whenever
you need to use shop module.

A simple use case if described in https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22754

To define your list, you only need to add an array ini variable called 'ProductDatatypeStringList'
under the [ShopSettings] group in any of your site.ini.append.php files

A commented out example is included in settings/site.ini file
