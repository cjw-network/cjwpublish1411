Event system
============

Intro
-----
See 4.5/event.txt for full information on this feature


API Change
----------
{@see ezpEvent->filter()} can now take more then one variable.


New events
----------
{@see ezpEvent->notify()}


request/preinput ( eZURI $uri )

Makes it possible to do logic straight after siteaccess and extensions settings has been loaded.


New filters
-----------
{@see ezpEvent->filter()}


response/preoutput  ( string $templateResult )

This filter 'response/preoutput' is triggered before the debug report,
which is printed at the end of the page, when debug is activated.
That way, you can use accumulator or append debug report
in your callback, they will appear in the final debug report
(at the opposite of response/output filter which is triggered at the very end,
after the report...)


content/view        ( int $nodeId, eZINI $siteINI )

Executed just after params has been set to variables, makes it possible to change node id based on some condition
or change siteini settings for the request.
