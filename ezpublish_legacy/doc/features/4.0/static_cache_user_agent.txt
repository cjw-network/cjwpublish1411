Static cache user agent
=======================

#009126: Static cache uses old cache to create new cache on publishing
http://issues.ez.no/IssueView.php?Id=9126&ProjectId=3

The fix for issue #9126 is to make the cache generator identify itself as such
in the request it uses to update the static cache. The user agent string in
such requests is now "eZ Publish static cache generator".

In order to take advantage of this, you should create a conditional in your
web server, based on the user agent string. In Apache, use something like
this, followed by rewrite rules for the static cache:

# If the user agent is not "eZ Publish static cache generator"
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !^eZ\ Publish\ static\ cache\ generator$
# then rewrite to static cache

NOTE:
The traditional solution is still valid, i.e. to have different host names for
the dynamic and the static cached eZ Publish. If you use this solution, you
don't have change anything.
