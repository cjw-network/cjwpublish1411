User Registration with workflow
===============================

Intro
-----
The purpose of this feature is to reuse the workflow for the user registration action.
Approvers (such as editors) can now approve new user registrations like a normal content object.

Please read eZ Publish 4.5 documentation in doc.ez.no for detailed use.
