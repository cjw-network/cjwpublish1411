Changes to backwards-compatibility and behaviour
================================================

Starting with eZ Publish 4.1 we will be tracking changes relating to BC and
behaviour more closely. There will be a dedicated file with information about
changes which fall into this category.

The file will be targeted at developers. There will be one file for every
released version, if necessary.

The file can be found at::
    <ezp-root>/doc/bc/4.1/changes-4.1.0.txt
