By default, the WebDAV files are sent to Trash when deleted. The administrator
of the site is responsible to empty the Trash. If you want to remove the files
directly (without using the Trash), this setting must be changed in content.ini
::

  [RemoveSettings]
  # delete or trash
  DefaultRemoveAction=delete
