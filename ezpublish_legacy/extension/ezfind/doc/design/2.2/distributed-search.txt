On the fly refactoring: aggregator fields
=========================================

Define more aggregator fields and make them configurable in ezfind.ini

This speeds up searching in general and allows for multi-core searching with
possible different information sources

Note: these are not the final field names

* id (will be copied to from current ezfind unique id)
* date_modified
* date_created
* author
* uri
* tags
* name/title/any short field(s)
* body
