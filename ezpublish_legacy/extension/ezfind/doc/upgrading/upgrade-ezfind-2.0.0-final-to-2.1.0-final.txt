Upgrade instructions
====================

1) Adding a table to the database
---------------------------------
The new Elevation feature ( sponsored results ) requires a new table in the database.
Add it in the database used by your eZ Publish instance.
You can do so as follows ( from eZ Publish's root directory ), in the case you are using MySQL:

   $> mysql -u <user> -p <database_name> < extension/ezfind/sql/ezfind_elevate_configuration.mysql.sql

The procedure is very similar in case you are using another RDMS. Please refer to the
documentation reference for your DBMS if you are experiencing issues.


2) Re-indexing is needed as schema.xml has changed
--------------------------------------------------
New fields were declared for a better multilanguage
behaviour. Because of the schema change,
re-indexing your site is required.
