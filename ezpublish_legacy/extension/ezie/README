Adding custom watermarks
========================

The image editor supports adding custom watermarks to the existing set (which can of course be modified):

* Place your watermark file (usually a PNG) in a 'watermark' subfolder of an 'images' design folder::
  extension/mydesign/design/standard/images/watermarks/logo_ubuntu.png
* Add the new watermark file to the list of used watermarks in image.ini::
  ; extension/mydesign/settings/image.ini.append.php
  [eZIE]
  watermarks[]=logo_ubuntu.png
* Clear your caches

The custom file will be visible in the list.

FAQ
=======================
Q: Why do I get a message "The image is not loaded because of a server error." after I click 'Edit' button in image attribute?
A: That is because there is a connection error. Please check log file to see the log. There are some possible reasons:
- the image library is not configured correctly. Please see requirement in http://doc.ez.no/Extensions/eZ-Image-Editor/Setup-and-user-guide-eZ-Image-Editor/Requirements.
- connection error. Please make sure the connection is working.
