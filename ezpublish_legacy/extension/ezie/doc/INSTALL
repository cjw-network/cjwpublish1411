- eZ Image Editor 1.0 extension installation documentation

About eZ Image Editor
=====================

An image editor for simple and usual image modifications integrated in the
editing interface of any eZ Publish Content Object that has at least an image
as attribute.

It allows croping, fliping, rotating, watermarking an image as well as modifying
some of its attributes such as the contrast or brightness.

Requirements
============

    eZ Publish 4.2 and higher

    PHP 5.2 and higher + PHP GD2
    or
    PHP 5.2 and higher + ImageMagick


Installation
============

 1. Unpack/unzip

    Unpack the downloaded zip package into the 'extension' directory of your
    eZ Publish installation.

 2. Activate extension

    Activate the extension by using the admin interface ( Setup -> Extensions ) or by
    prepending ezie to ActiveExtensions[] in settings/override/site.ini.append.php:

    [ExtensionSettings]
    ActiveExtensions[]=ezie

 3. Regenerate autoload array

    Check the eZ Publish docs for your version on how this is done.
    Or go to Setup -> Extensions and click on the button there.

 4. Clear caches

    Clear INI and template caches (from admin 'Setup' tab or commandline).

 5. Clustering

    If you run eZ Publish in cluster mode, you need to add a rewrite rule towards the cluster index::
    Rewriterule ^/var/([^/]+/)?cache/public/ezie/.*         /index_cluster.php [L]

Using eZ Image Editor
=====================

See README.

eZ Publish cluster
==================

If you're using an eZDB or eZDFS based cluster setup, custom changes are required to get the images streamed correctly
through the cluster index script. You can use the doc/clusterindex.diff file::

patch -p0 < extension/ezie/doc/clusterindex.diff

These changes will be part of the 4.4 release of eZ Publish.
