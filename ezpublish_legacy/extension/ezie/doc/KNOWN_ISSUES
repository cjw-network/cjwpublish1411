KNOWN ISSUES on EZIE
====================

Black & White filter applied to a region
----------------------------------------

The black & white filter won't apply to a specific region but to the whole document. The reason hasn't been found in the
ezie code itself, and might require investigation in the conversion ezcomponent.

This only occurs with JPG files. It works fine with PNG and GIF.

The bug has been narrowed down to the imagemagick command line. The following line will convert the whole image even
though the region parameter is correct::
    /usr/local/bin/myconvert 'test.jpg' -region '341x379+291+178' -colorspace 'Gray' -colors '255' 'JPG:test-out.jpg'

Extra info:
 * this does work when the output is a PNG file. So it's not an input, but output problem.
 * this happens on ImageMagick 6.3.7 on Ubuntu, and other platforms as well (the QA team has noticed it too)

We should probably report an imagemagick bug, as the generated command line is okay and works with other file formats
and color spaces.


Default eZ Publish image.ini settings will make ezcImageConverter fail
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The default ezp image.ini contains ImageMagick.Executable = 'convert' and ImageMagick.ExecutablePath = ''. This is an issue with the current code, as we use this configuration for the component, and end up with a binary named convert. If a custom binary setting is sent to the component, it won't look in the path, and will therefore throw an exception since it won't find a file by that name in the current directory.

Selection dimension fields are not updated when selecting a region
------------------------------------------------------------------

The dimension fields (width & height) in the right column are not updated when selecting a region using the mouse.y
