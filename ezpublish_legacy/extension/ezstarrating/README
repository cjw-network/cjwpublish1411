eZ Star Rating extension for eZ Publish
=======================================
Star Rating is an extension that allows the addition of a rating system
to eZ publish content objects via a dedicated datatype.

ezstarating has a dependency on ezjscore, you'll find more info on it here:
http://projects.ez.no/ezjscore

The current version allows ratings between 1 and 5 stars; users can vote
once per session.

The eZ Star Rating module contains images and CSS from Komodo media
