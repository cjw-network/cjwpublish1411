o  Web Server:
   
   # Virtual Host Setup
   If you are using rewrite rules, you need to allow stylesheets and javascript
   files from your var folder, add this rewrite rule if you are running apache:

   RewriteRule ^/var/([^/]+/)?cache/public/.* - [L]


   # .htaccess Setup
   If you use .htaccess to protect your eZ Publish 4.0 setup (4.1 not affected),
   you'll need to change your rewrite rule from:
   
   RewriteRule !\.(gif|jpe?g|png|css|js|html)|var(.+)storage.pdf(.+)\.pdf$ index.php
   
   to:
   
   RewriteRule !\.(gif|jpe?g|png|css|js|html?)|var(.+)storage.pdf(.+)\.pdf$ index.php


Getting eZ Publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ Publish from ez.no, you will find the
various versions at:
http://share.ez.no/download-develop/downloads

NOTE: You will need eZ Publish 4.0 or higher.

Information on the installation of eZ Publish can be found at:
http://doc.ez.no/


Installing eZ Online Editor 5.x extension
=========================================

1. Download the ezoe package.

   Windows users should download the "zip" package. Linux/UNIX/OS X users may
   download any package format as long as the necessary unpacking tools are
   available.

2. Copy the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your
   eZ Publish installation.

3. Unpack the files in the distribution.

   Windows users should unzip the files. The 'ezoe' directory will be created
   inside the 'extension' directory.

   Linux users may use of the following commands depending on the file type:
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezoe-extension-[ExtensionVersion].tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf ezoe-extension-[ExtensionVersion].bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezoe-extension-[ExtensionVersion].zip
   
4. Add the Apache rewrite rules

  a. For Virtual Host Setup
   As mentioned in the Requirements part, you'll need to add rewrite rules to
   enable css and javascript to be loaded from your cache folder.
   (OE packs several css / js files together and caches the result)

   So if you have:
   RewriteRule ^/var/[^/]+/cache/texttoimage/.* - [L]

   Modify it like this:
   RewriteRule ^/var/[^/]+/cache/(texttoimage|public)/.* - [L]
   
   Or add a rewrite rule like this:
   RewriteRule ^/var/([^/]+/)?cache/public/.* - [L]
   
   Alternatively you can set site.ini[eZJSCore]Packer=disabled
   and ezjscore will stop using this cache technique.
   Please override the setting in settings/override/ instead of changing
   the files in the extension.

  b. For .htaccess setup
   See Requirements -> Web Server -> .htaccess Setup section above in this file.

5. Enable the ezoe extension in eZ Publish.

   To enable ezoe for all of your siteaccesses, log in to your eZ Publish
   administration interface, click on the 'Setup' tab, and then click
   'Extensions' on the left. You will see the list of available extensions.
   Select the 'ezoe' item and click the 'Apply changes' button.
   Aternatively, you can also edit the file 'site.ini.append.php' located
   in the 'settings/override' directory. Add the following line under
   the [ExtensionSettings] section:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezoe

   Create the file and/or the section if they do not exist.

   To enable ezoe for only a single siteaccess, open the 'site.ini.append.php'
   file located in the 'settings/siteaccess/your_siteaccess' directory.
   Add the following line under the [ExtensionSettings] section:

   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezoe

   Create the file and/or the section if they do not exist.
   
   NOTE: Make sure you disable the old editor also (ezdhtml)

 6. Regenerate autoload array

   Check the eZ Publish docs for your version on how this is done.
   Or go to Setup -> Extensions and click on the button there.

7. Set the Image class

   In eZ Publish, images are usually stored as Image objects. ezoe allows you
   to insert various objects into XML fields. ezoe uses the identifier of the
   image classes to determine whether the inserted object is an image or not.

   To check your Image Class identifier, log in to your eZ Publish administration
   interface, access the 'Setup' tab, and then click 'Classes' on the left.
   You will see the list of class groups. Select the 'Media' group and find
   the image class. The default identifier of this class is 'image' in a standard
   eZ Publish installation. If your Image class identifier is not 'image', open the
   'content.ini.append.php' file in settings/overrides/ or in one of you siteaccess 
   settings. Look for the [RelationGroupSettings] section, or add a new one like this:

   [RelationGroupSettings]
   ImagesClassList[]=image

   Replace 'image' with the identifier of the image class that your installation
   is using, and add more entries if you have several image classes.

8. Add permission to Editor users (optional)

   Some parts of the editor have possibility to limit rights pr user,
   this means you need to give editors access to all or parts of the 
   'ezoe' module so they can use the editor.
   The function 'editor' in the 'ezoe' module defines access to the editor.
   While 'relations' is to control if the user should have access to adding and
   changing embed objects/images while the editor is enabled.


9. Clear all the eZ Publish caches.

   Log in to your eZ Publish administration interface, select the 'Setup' tab,
   and then click the 'Clear all caches' button. If you use eZ Publish 3.6
   or higher, you can also use the developer toolbar (if enabled) located
   in the right hand side. Simply select 'All caches' from the drop-down list
   and click the 'Clear' button.

   Alternatively if you have PHP CLI installed, you can also do the following:

   $ ./bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-all

10. Clear the browser caches

   Browsers usually cache visited pages in a folder somewhere. The next time
   the same pages are visited, they are loaded faster because some of the
   information already exists on the local storage device. If you already have
   ezoe installed and you're upgrading it then you will have to clear the
   browser's cache.
