# NOTE: It is not recommended to edit this files directly, instead

#       settings/override/viewcache.ini.append.php for more security

[ViewCacheSettings]
# Determines which types of related objects will be choosen to clear view cache
# when publishing current object.
# Possible values are:
# common                    - common relations made on object level
# embedded                  - embedded objects
# linked                    - linked objects
# attribute                 - relations made with attributes of 'object relation' or
#                             'object relations' datatypes
# reverse_common            - reverse common relations (objects that relate the one currently
#                             being published) on object level
# reverse_embedded          - objects that have current object as embedded
# reverse_linked            - objects that have linked current object
# reverse_attribute         - objects that have current object as related in their attributes.

# Controls the smart viewcache handler, use enabled, disabled or exclusive.
# When the handler is disabled the system will clear the viewcache
# for all published nodes of the current object, its parent(s), reverse
# related objects and objects with same keywords (if any).
# When enabled it will in addition try to follow the rules set in viewcache.ini
# for more advanced relations between objects. e.g. to clear a forum
# listing when a new topic or reply is posted.
# When exclusive, settings for specific classes are used exclusively
# (if defined), instead of in addition to the default settings.

# The structure of the group is:
#[<class_identifier>]
