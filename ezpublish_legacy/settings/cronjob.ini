# NOTE: It is not recommended to edit this files directly, instead

#       values that is required for your site. Either create
#       a file called settings/override/cronjob.ini.append or
#       settings/override/cronjob.ini.append.php for more security
#       in non-virtualhost modes (the .php file may already be present
#       and can be used for this purpose).

# No more than one instance of a cronjob script can be run at any given time.
# If a script uses more time than MaxScriptExecutionTime, the next instance of
# it will try to gracefully steal the cronjob script mutex. If the process has
# been running for more than two times MaxScriptExecutionTime, the original
# process will be killed. The default is 12 hours. MaxScriptExecutionTime can
# also be set per cronjob part, that will override this global setting.
