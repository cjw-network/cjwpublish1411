# The "Create here" menu when clicking the node icon in the administrator interface.
#   disabled   - Not having the menu.
#   full       - Having the menu with the necessary permission checks - this will most likely slow down the interface.
#   simplified - Having the menu without the necessary permission checks 
#                (in other words: the menu will include all classes regardless 
#                 if the logged in user is allowed to create all those classes at that exact location). 
#                Some users might get ACCESS DENIED, but it might just work for the most typical/usual cases 
#                (where only one admin or a bunch of admins without limitations are using the interface).
