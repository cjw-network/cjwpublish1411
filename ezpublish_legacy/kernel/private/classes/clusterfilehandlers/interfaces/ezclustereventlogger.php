 * Interface for eZClusterEvent loggers.

 * Cluster events can be used either inside eZ Publish (cache read/write, file handling...), but also
 * through index_cluster.php in order to serve binary files.
 * In the last case, the process should be as fast as possible and consume less resources as possible.
 * Thus we should not include heavy dependencies on eZ Publish utility classes like eZDebug in order to log errors.
 * This interface is to be implemented by classes dedicated to error logging, depending on context.
