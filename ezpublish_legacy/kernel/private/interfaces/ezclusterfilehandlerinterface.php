    /**
     * Handles cache requests / write operations
     *
     * Creates a single transaction out of the typical file operations for
     * accessing caches. Caches are normally ready from the database or local
     * file, if the entry does not exist or is expired then it generates the new
     * cache data and stores it. This method takes care of these operations and
     * handles the custom code by performing callbacks when needed.
     *
     * The $retrieveCallback is used when the file contents can be used (ie. not
     * re-generation) and is called when the file is ready locally.
     * The function will be called with the file path as the first parameter, the
     * mtime as the second and optionally $extraData as the third.
     * The function must return the file contents or an instance of
     * eZClusterFileFailure which can be used to tell the system that the
     * retrieve data cannot be used after all.
     *
     * $retrieveCallback can be set to null which makes the system go directly
     * to the generation.
     *
     * The $generateCallback is used when the file content is expired or does not
     * exist, in this case the content must be re-generated and stored. The
     * function will be called with the file path as the first parameter and
     * optionally $extraData as the second.
     * The function must return an array with information on the contents, the
     * array consists of:
     *  - scope      - The current scope of the file, is optional.
     *  - datatype   - The current datatype of the file, is optional.
     *  - content    - The file content, this can be any type except null.
     *  - binarydata - The binary data which is written to the file.
     *  - store      - Whether *content* or *binarydata* should be stored to the
     *                 file, if false it will simply return the data. Optional,
     *                 by default it is true.
     * Note: Set $generateCallback to false to disable generation callback.
     * Note: Set $generateCallback to null to tell the function to perform a
     *       write lock but not do any generation, the generation must done be
     *       done by the caller by calling @see storeCache().
     *
     * Either *content* or *binarydata* must be supplied, if not an error is
     * issued and it returns null.
     *
     * If *content* is set it will be used as the return value of this function,
     * if not it will return the binary data.
     * If *binarydata* is set it will be used as the binary data for the file, if
     * not it will perform a var_export on *content* and use that as the binary
     * data.
     *
     * For convenience the $generateCallback function can return a string which
     * will be considered as the binary data for the file and returned as the
     * content.
     *
     * For controlling how long a cache entry can be used the parameters
     * @see $expiry and @see $ttl is used.
     * @see $expiry can be set to a timestamp which controls the absolute max
     * time for the cache, after this time/date the cache will never be used.
     * If the value is set to a negative value or null there the expiration check
     * is disabled.
     *
     * $ttl (time to live) tells how many seconds the cache can live from the
     * time it was stored. If the value is set to negative or null there is no
     * limit for the lifetime of the cache. A value of 0 means that the cache
     * will always expire and practically disables caching. For the cache to be
     * used both the $expiry and $ttl check must hold.
